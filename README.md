# Build Anomatron
  Overview:
    Build Anomatron is a machine learning project focused on detecting anomalies in build processes. It utilizes various techniques such as Z-score, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM to identify unusual patterns in build data.

# Features
  * Anomaly Detection: Implements multiple algorithms to detect anomalies in build and deployment processes.
  * Data Analysis: Analyzes build data such as execution time and status to identify potential issues.
  * Visualization: Provides visual insights into the build data and detected anomalies.
